    "Python supports many data types. Some of them are common among other programming languages and some of them are native to Python.\n",

The variable does not need to be typecasted and python automatically assigns the data type to the variable based on the value it is assigned. (i.e., If x='Hello', then 'x' is automatically identified by python as a string variable. If 'x' is re-assigned a value of 12.6, say x=12.6, then 'x' is automatically identified as a float)"

    "### Format specifiers in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "When you want to put a placeholder for a variable and pass the value to the function separately, we can use something called format specifier. This is typically a set of symbols which tell the function about the format in which the value being passed is to be printed. Format specifiers for various types of data types in Python are similar to other programming languages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* %d for integer\n",
    "* %f for float\n",
    "* %s for string\n",
    "* %r for raw object using 'repr' method\n",
    "* %x for hex code\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the format specifiers as placeholders in a print statement, and pass the value of a specific variable using the '%' operator. Multiple variables/values can also be passed by enclosing all variables in paranthesis and separating them by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 10\n",
    "b = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"I want to print %d and %d in the same sentence\"%(a,b))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output\n",
    ">>> I want to print 10 and 5 in the same sentence\n",

    "\n",
    "# Output\n",
    ">>> I want to print 10.264725 and a string type in the same sentence\n",
    "```\n",
    "Alternative to the '%' operator, we have the format() function which can also be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 10\n",
    "b = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"I want to print {:d} and {:d} in the same sentence\".format(a,b))\n",

    "#### Rounding off a float and adding preceeding zeroes\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, where we had a float value, we may want to restrict the number of decimals and print a rounded value. On the other hand we may want to add a preceeding zero to the number, in case the value a here is a single observation in a larger pool of numbers which have 3 digits before the decimal.\n",
    "We can add preceeding zeroes and round off float values by specifying the type of formatting for a float, after the '%' symbol and before the 'f' symbol of the format specifier.\n",
    "* Use a period symbol ('.') to denote the decimal in the float value\n",
    "* For preceeding zeroes, add total desired length of the number (including decimal point), in digits, before the period symbol. And before this number, add a '0' to denote that all preceeding blank spaces need to be filled with zeroes.\n",
    "* For rounding off decimals, add the number up to which you want decimals, right after the period symbol and before the 'f' symbol\n",
    "\n",

    "1. {:.2f}\n",
    "2. {:.3f}\n",
    "3. {:4.4f}\n",
    "4. {:04.4f}\n",
    "5. {:8.4f}\n",
    "6. {:08.4f}\n",

    ">>> 1. 10.26\n",

    ">>> 3. 10.2647\n",
    ">>> 4. 10.2647\n",
    ">>> 5.  10.2647\n",
    ">>> 6. 010.2647\n",
    ">>> 7. 00010.2647\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Important note:</b> In above example '{:4.4f}' and '{04.4f}' give the same output, where we cannot see any padding (neither blanks nor zeroes). This is because the length that we specified for the string is 4, whereas we have also asked for 4 digits after the decimal point. So the digits after decimal take precedence and these 4 digits are added first.\n",
    "Then the whole number is generated - the characteristic (digits before decimal) and the mantissa (digits after the decimal). After this the control checks to add padding. It now finds that the condition for length of number we have specified is 4, and the length of number is already more than 4, hence it does not add any padding blanks or zeroes.\n",

    "* / for division - Divides the value of left hand side variable (called Dividend) with the value of right hand side variable (called Divisor) and returns 'Quotient'\n",
