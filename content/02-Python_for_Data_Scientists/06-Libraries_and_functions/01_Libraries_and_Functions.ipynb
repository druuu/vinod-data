    "# Libraries and Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section of the course, we will learn about functons in python. We will see how to write functions and invoke them in code along with various other topics such as built-in functions, libraries and modules. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function basics - User defined functions\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a block of code that executes in a sequence and can be invoked in a repeated fashion. \n",
    "\n",
    "In python, as in other languages, users can define their own set of functions such that a set of statements can be invoked multiple times from other parts of the program. The function definition starts with the keyword 'def'. Here is an example of a function that takes in two numbers and returns their sum:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# function to add two values\n",
    "def add_values(x, y):\n",
    "  z = x + y\n",
    "  return z\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here x, y, z are called local variables as they only retain their values inside the function. This function is invoked as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>print(add_values(5, 10))\n",
    "15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the formatting of the code. The function define statement starts with the 'def' keyword and the statement ends with a ':'. Just like a decision statement or a loop, the lines of code which are to be included within this namespace are indented. i.e., all statements that are to be part of the function defined are to be indented.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a simple function to calculate the cube (power 3) of a given number. Find the cube of the number 16 using this function."

    "#### Enumerate function\n",
    "\n",
    "The enumerate function is a special function which acts as an iterator within an iterable object. It is really useful and helps solve programming issues which often require lengthy logics to solve. The function captures both the element of the iterable and its index/position within the iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "test_list = [10,2.53954,6,7,5,-1,3,8,9,4]\n",
    "\n",
    "for index,number in enumerate(test_list):\n",
    "    print(index,number)\n",
    "    \n",
    "# Output\n",
    ">>> 0 10\n",
    ">>> 1 2.53954\n",
    ">>> 2 6\n",
    ">>> 3 7\n",
    ">>> 4 5\n",
    ">>> 5 -1\n",
    ">>> 6 3\n",
    ">>> 7 8\n",
    ">>> 8 9\n",
    ">>> 9 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When the enumerate function is coupled with a decision statement, like if, it can be used to find second occurrence of a specific element within the iterable object. This is a very useful functionality and is really simple to implement in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "recur = [7,2,6,5,8,3,6,3,6,9,3,5,8,9,4,2,6,4]\n",
    "\n",
    "# finding second occurence of 3\n",
    "index_3 = [index for index,number in enumerate(recur) if number==3] # returns list of all indices from iterable where value is 3\n",
    "index_3[1] # second occurrence index\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output\n",
    ">>> 7\n",
    "\n",
    "# finding second occurence of 5 - in a single line\n",
    "[index for index,number in enumerate(recur) if number==5][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output\n",
    ">>> 11\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise\n",

    "Python has a standard library where functions such as print(), range(), len() can be invoked at any point in our code. However, some functions that belong to a category of operations often exist in modules. For example, if we intend to use a logartithm, a square root operation, then such operations exist in a module called the 'math' module. Similarly, there are many modules in python that we can leverage to write our code. These modules need to be imported to use them.\n",

    "Syntax:\n",
    "```\n",

    "print(addTwo(4))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output\n",

    "print(v(4))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output\n",
    ">>> 6\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "In th above code, 'lambda' defines the function for one-time use, and passes a variable 'e' (without parenthesis).\n",
    "It is followed by a ':' similar to a function definition. followed by the returned value via the expression 'e+2'.\n",
    "The result of this function is assigned to a variable v. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can be dynamic with lambda expressions such as below:\n",

    "```Python\n",
    "product_of_3_ints = lambda v1,v2,v3:v1*v2*v3\n",
