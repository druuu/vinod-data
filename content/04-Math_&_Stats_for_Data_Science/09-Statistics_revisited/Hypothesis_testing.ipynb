    "# Basic idea behind hypothesis testing \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are a web designer. Your are rebuilding a really sweet website for this new company that you are working with. Your are done everything except for the opening page, you can't seem to decide what color you want to choose for it hence you ask your boss. Your boss says we have had a red opening page for the longest time and that it works. You say, na! If we switch the color to green we will get more people to stay on the site since green is pleasing to the eye. \n",
    "\n",
    "How would you resolve this situation by using data ? \n",
    "\n",
    "This is where we can utilize hypothesis testing. The various steps of hypothesis testing are- \n",
    "\n",
    "* Define what statistic you want to use for doing hypothesis test- we are going to be mostly using the mean \n",
    "* Define the alternate and the null hypothesis in terms of step 1 \n",
    "* Define a significance level for your problem   \n",
    "* Calculate the test statistic  \n",
    "* Compare the test statistic to the significance level and based on the condition either accept or reject the null hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Defining the statistic that you are going to be using \n",
    "Lets take problem that we defined earlier. One statistic we can use the mean time spent on the website. Suppose your boss gives you the data of how much time people spend on the current opening page which is red. You get the mean value of the time spent there, say its 5 mins. Hence, our definition null and alternate hypothesis will have to be in terms of this parameter which is the mean or average amount of time that people spend on the website. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Define the null and alternate hypothesis \n",
    "So in step 1 I mentioned that the average time spent on the website opening page was currently 5 mins. So your alternate hypothesis will be that average time spent on the website will be greater than 5 mins after the change in the page color. \n",
    "Your null hypothesis is that even after the change the average time spent on the opening page will be less than or equal to 5. So lets write this down in a more formal way- \n",
    "\n",
    "$H_o : \\mu_o \\leq 5$  mins  <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "$H_a : \\mu_a > 5$ mins \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Defining the significance level \n",
    "So the significance level (also known as the alpha level) is probability value. This is a threshold beyond which you will reject the null hypothesis. This is the equivalent of saying that If I more than 5 in 100 samples the mean is different from a threshold we set, then we will reject the null hypothesis. This will become clear as we go along. Typically when a significance level is not given you can assume a significance level denoted by $\\alpha$ as $\\alpha= 0.05$\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Calculate the test statistic\n",
    "This is the main calculation that we have to do. In our example, what our boss gave us was essentially defines a population of time spent on the opening page. We can get a mean from that. Then what we do is generate our own sample. We do this by first making a change in the opening page to green and then recording average time people spend on it. Suppose took a sample of 10 people and found that people spent on average about 6 mins on the website with a standard deviation of 1 min. Then our sample mean $\\bar x= 6 $ mins. Once we have this information we plug this into - \n",

    "\n",
    "$\\begin{align}z_c = \\dfrac{({\\bar x - \\mu_p})}{{\\bar \\sigma}/{\\sqrt{n}}} \\end{align}$\n",

    "$z_c$ is called the critical value or sometimes the test statistic <br>\n",
    "$\\bar x$ is the sample mean  <br>\n",
    "$\\mu $ is the population mean  <br>\n",
    "$\\sigma $ is the sample standard deviation <br>\n",
    "$n$ is the sample size. In our case $n =10$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, so we can only define the test statistic above since we have chose our statistic to be mean, if we change that to something else. The expression above will also change \n",
    "\n",
    "What we are actually looking at in equation (1) is nothing more than normal distribution. See, since in our sample size of the population will be greater than 30 units we can represent the population mean as a normal distribution. Once we do that calculating $z_c$ is easy since all we have to do is plug in the numbers and we will get $z_c$. So lets actually do that. \n",

    "* Type II error -  Accepting null hypothesis when it should be rejected \n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the situation one type of error will be worse then another type. For instance, in the above example, suppose we made a Type I error and said that the average time after changing the page color went up when in reality it stayed the same, then its okay. But suppose in second case where the average time spent viewing the page was less than population, we might actually lose revenue by making a Type II error since we assume that the null hypothesis can be accepted but the truth is that we need to actually reject it and accept the alternate hypothesis. This is especially true in the field of medicine where accepting the wrong hypothesis can be fatal to a patient! Either way in all cases. Be careful about making these errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "So how can we get around these types of errors? Collect more data! The larger your sample size is the smaller its standard deviation will be. Remember from equation(1) the standard error is proportional to the inverse of the square root of the sample size. So the larger that sample size is the smaller standard error is! So use this to your advantage. \n",

So whenever you read about hypothesis testing you will very often come across this term. In fact, in many softwares and statistical packages you will find that apart from giving you $z_c$ values, it will output p-values as well. Sometime studies or academic papers will just report p-values rather any other information \n",

We calculated the probability value and found it to be $0.0008$ now $0.0008 < \\alpha$ and under this condition we accepted the significance level. So this probability value that we are calculating from the $z_c$ is question useful since we can just ask if it is great or lesser than the significance level. It saves us from writing down a $z_\\alpha$ value and lets us directly deal with probabilities. This probability value is called p-value. So we can generalize the message and say-  \n",

The p-value for a two tail test is double that for a single tail test of the same $z_c$ value since you can find a sample on the other extreme of  of the the distribution. So now that we can presented the definition of p value, lets visualize it- \n"
